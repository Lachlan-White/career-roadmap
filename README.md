## Career Roadmap

A simple markdown template to help ask the what and why questions for your career, along with certain ratios to help make decisions.

This template was made to serve as a usable example of the worksheet mentioned in my [blog post][0]

## Contributing

It would be excellent for people who use the template to contribute their 'roadmaps' back as examples.

If you wish to do so please create a Pull Request, with the example under a folder which is named on the type of area your career is focused on.

As an example that may be Software Development or DevOps.
