## Career Roadmap

### Job 1 - Cloud Engineer

#### Why?

After working on a service desk for a few years, I loved the aspects of solving problems, but I had become frustrated with my inability to solve problems holistically for those who called our service desk. I am hungry to learn more deep technical skills and look to help build platforms, systems and solutions leveraging automation so that I can do more with less.

The engineering team seem to always be in the middle of the action, be that responding to, or solving incidents in the middle of the night or providing feedback on designs and architectures on future projects. It seems like a great way to build up my technical expertise and gain exposure to architecture which is something I want to pursue later on in my career.

#### What?

I want to learn more about DevOps and the way that engineering practices are potentially looking to change from On-Premises based infrastructure such as vSphere and Hyper-V to Cloud based systems like AWS and Azure. I want to learn how to build systems and automate basic tasks so I can help to solve higher level problems and potential after a year or so start to form opinions on what works or doesn't work based on architecture diagrams and requirements.

Key Technologies and Tools:

- PowerShell
- GitHub
- ARM Templates
- Chef / Puppet
- Ansible
- Jenkins
